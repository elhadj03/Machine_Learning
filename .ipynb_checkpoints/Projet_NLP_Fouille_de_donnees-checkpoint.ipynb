Le fichier des documents est formaté dans un tableau cvs (un avis par ligne), un autre fichier csv contient les polarités d'avis par document (- 1/+1).

    "Vous utiliserez les différents types de données d'entrée selon les prétraitements. ​Le but est d'utiliser vos textes avec différentes informations, en préparant 3 versions du corpus :\n",
    "(1) Textes bruts (avec ou sans suppression de stop-words),\n",
    "(2) Textes lemmatisés,\n",
    "(3) Textes lemmatisés avec analyse morphosyntaxique (à l'aide de l'outil Tree-tagger vu en cours).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pensez à la possibilité d'appliquer des prétraitements personnalisés selon vos besoins et votre corpus (e.g., liste de stop-words personnalisée). Avec l'outil Tree-tagger (​http://www.cis.unimuenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/​) vous pouvez ajouter à chaque mot sa catégorie grammaticale et enrichir l'espace des descripteurs et ainsi comprendre si cette information peut aider (ou non) à classer votre corpus. Attention au format d'entrée utilisé par Tree-tagger. Vous pouvez également vous intéresser à d'autres types de connaissances linguistiques (par exemple, la terminologie, la sémantique, etc.).\n",
    "Si vous utilisez Scikit Learn, il est possible d’utiliser les librairies NLTK ou Scapy pour faire l’analyse lexicale.\n",

    "La suite du travail consistera à utiliser Weka et à évaluer rigoureusement les résultats de classification obtenus en prenant en entrée les différents corpus préparés dans l'étape précédent. Rappelons que de nombreuses approches d'apprentissage peuvent alors être utilisées pour la classification de textes :\n",
    "• K plus proches voisins,\n",

    "\n",
    "## Etape 4 : Analyse\n",
    "Une analyse complète de la qualité de la classification selon les différents types d'entrées et types de prétraitements par modèle de classification et paramétrage doit être proposée. Autrement dit, les combinaisons différentes de modèle + paramètres + pondération + type de données d'entrée donneront des performances différentes. A vous de les comparer et configurer votre fonction de classification pour qu'elle soit le plus performante possible sur les données de test en proposant une analyse approfondie de vos résultats.\n",
    "Remarque 1 : L​ e thème de la classification des textes laisse penser que certains types de mots peuvent se révéler particulièrement discriminants (par exemple, les adjectifs pour la classification d'opinion). Une discussion sur l'influence de tels marqueurs morphosyntaxiques sera bienvenue. Remarque 2 :​ Différents traitements (par exemple, pondérations, algorithmes de fouille de données comme l'extraction des règles d'association) ont été proposés par les encadrants du projet. Vous pourrez vous en inspirer pour présenter des résultats complémentaires aux résultats de classification.\n",

    "- Une soutenance orale de 20 minutes suivie de 10 minutes de questions est prévue à la fin du semestre. La soutenance a pour objectif de vous permettre de présenter vos approches, vos choix et de mettre en avant également l'analyse des résultats que vous avez obtenu. Il est inutile de perdre du temps lors de la présentation sur les données initiales (qui sont communes) ni sur la problématique du projet ou bien la théorie des méthodes utilisées.\n",
    "- Le rendu final consiste en :\n",
    "1. Rapport de ​max 10 pages décrivant les principaux pré-traitements et choix effectués ainsi que l’analyse de résultats. Ici aussi il n’est pas nécessaire de parler des données\n",
